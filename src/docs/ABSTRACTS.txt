# This is a line-by-line long package descripton usually append after the      #
# pitch or acting independently. You can write as long as you want as long as  #
# it complies to the following rules:                                          #
#       (1) Keep it text-form only; AND                                        #
#       (2) Max 69 characters per line (DEB, RPM, and Citation requires it);   #
#           AND                                                                #
#       (3) Keep it ASCII for backward compatibilities purposes.               #
#                                                                              #
# You should write the long description of the project repository like an      #
# abstract: introducing, specify the problem, actions, and ends with what to   #
# to exect from exploring it.                                                  #

Need an efficient error reporting in a memory constrained system?
Wants to keep your error messages internationalized? Having
inconsistencies for error reporting across multiple programming
languages? hestiaERROR, a component from Hestia super libraries is
here to resolve these problems.

Being as a single peaceful frontend+backend software library suite,
hestiaERROR utilizes 1-byte (8-bits) unsigned integer numbering to
represents 256 different sets of error conditions. By using
numbering system, hestiaERROR keeps the project a lot simplier and
making the error reporting isolated from language (as in English)
translations headache (compared to string type error reporting).

With its simple data type and value designations, you can
confidently operate with the highest consistencies even in the
smallest memory constraint environment (e.g. 8-bit microcontroller).
